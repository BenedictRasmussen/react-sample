This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Visit http://benedictrasmussen-react-sample.herokuapp.com/ to see this application. Please ensure `https` is not used- this sample project does not make use of TLS and Heroku does not allow an internal `https` connection to make `REST` calls to non-TLS sites, such as the Open Weather API used in this project.

# About the application
This application was developed to gain a high-level understanding of React. Two packages not included with `create-react-app` are `react-router-dom` and `react-unity-webgl`. The `react-router-dom` package allows for easy swapping of components without having to reload the entire DOM. `react-unity-webgl` affords a significantly more elegant solution for including a Unity application than is provided by the base WebGL build.
